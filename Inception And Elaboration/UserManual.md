## Description
This App lets someone make one or more Grocery shopping lists, each of which has many things chosen by the user if it is something they want to buy, they can add things to a list, get rid of things from the list, clear a list if they no longer go to a particular store.

### How to use
Open the app and take the user to the main screen, where they can make a new list, get rid of a list or go into a specific list. The buttons in each sections below will perform its corresponding CRUD action and user can have their information updated or preserved/deleted. The flow of the application can be more easily understood by the diagram given at the bottom of this file.

#### Homepage

From the app launcher, a user can open the app to see the following screen as the homepage. This is, given that there aren’t any items already added. This homepage will provide a “Add list” button which will be used to add a name and details of a grocery shopping list.

Upon clicking the “GLM” button, we get the edit grocery list item but without any items, looking a little different as given: 



This homepage has all the lists that the user has made thus far. It is here where a user can make or get rid of a list, or if they want to look at a specific list, if they are going to go shopping.

#### Edit item details screen

Similar to previous funcitons you can edit items, etc. Simple and intuitive UI, renaming button and delete button is clear and simple.
