Summary: Doing the first part of this grouproject, we learned to collaborate as a group and discuss about the requirement and helped each to finish the assignment. We learned to collaborate as team in a timely manner. When one person misses a point, someone else comes in with their distinct point of view. We found way to communicate and how to best reach each other online. We also learnd how similar our ideas are to one another. We learned how to critique each other's design professionally without being rude about it. It was hard to put our thoughts into understandable language. In the end we all able to do each other part and hoping to finish the entire project by working as a team.
